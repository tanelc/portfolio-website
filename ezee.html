        <a id="caption">Introduction</a><br>
        The awareness for a vegan diet has never been higher. Health benefits such as lower blood sugar level, and a significantly diminished risk of heart disease have been documented in studies over recent years. Abandonment of meat and dairy
        products consumption reduces carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, too.
        <br>
        <a id="caption">Problem</a><br>
        Nutrition: The level of misinformation and confusion is high. Vegan eating is often considered unhealthy, lacking to provide the body sufficiently with proteins and vitamin B12 for example.

        Cooking: Finding a recipe with Google e.g. delivers an overwhelming number of results and makes it difficult, especially for inexperienced cooks or newly vegans to recognise a good recipe. It‘s time consuming and the outcome isn‘t
        reliable. If the meal turns out to be a disappointment, it will also discourage the cook.
        <br>
        <a id="caption">Solution</a><br>
        It's the perfect opportunity to establish an application with vegan recipes, nutritional information, and qualified experts ready to guide the users. The app can be customised to serve beginners and experienced vegans alike, providing a
        whole range of information and cooking inspiration.

          <p>Lorem meets the soup bowl - a clear and simple logo for Devil Soups, using black backgrounds whereever possible to add some drama. This company applys its logo on huge variety of different surfaces, sizes and materials.
            This calls for a limited amount of colours and several different versions of the logo to fit every need.</p>

          <a id="caption">x.Step: Research</a><br>
          <p>Based on the results from the first survey we go into detail by interviewing four candidates, covering different life styles and cooking habits – from omnivore with interest in healthly eating to longtime vegan. The interviews took
            place via Zoom/Skype. To my surprise the interviewees had concerns video calling an expert. This is mainly due to lack of trust and insecurity of video calling a stranger.

          <h3>Insights</h3>
          <p><a id="caption">1. The Expert</a><br>
            There is so much information about vegan eating and especially people new to this topic are insecure. Anyone can claim to be an expert. Experts with a cooking or nutritionist background are a must. And, for video calls we need to build
            up trust and prove that our expert is trustworthy.
            <br>
            Features: By showing easy recipes, advice and cooking sessions the users experience the living proof. It could reduce the barrier of contacting a stranger. A rating system delivers additional guidance for users who want to contact an
            expert.
            <br>
            <br>
            <a id="caption">2. Behaviour Phone & Apps</a><br>
            Communicating through WhatsApp is by far more popular than Video Calls. The advantages are that good reception isn’t as crucial, you can leave Voice Messages and communicate while you´re on the go. Keeping in mind that the expert has to
            prove his/her trustworthiness, it would be a good idea to let the user choose a communication channel.<br>Features: An additional chat function on top of the video calls would be appreciated by the users. And by giving the video call more
            functions like “Make an appointment” or “Call back” could make it more attractive.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a id="caption">3. Interviewees</a><br>
            The interviewees show great interest in vegan eating and are willing to try it or already cook vegan. They often use Google when they look for a new recipe which can be very frustrating.
            Their aim is to feel proud of what they created, to have reassurance of the time and effort they invested was worth it. The motivation level is high, with laziness popping up every now and then.
            <br>
            Features: It would be helpful to make daily suggestions, to spread inspirations. Additional online cooking sessions offer full guidance and include interaction. A friendly daily reminder to treat yourself with a home-cooked vegan meal
            could also be useful to keep it up.

      <p>Devil Soups in jars are sold in companys cafeterias such as Airbus. Three different soups available in two jar sizes. From meaty stews to vegan carrot soups. For one or two hungry eaters.
        This also meant getting back to packaging design and creating labels for all sorts.
