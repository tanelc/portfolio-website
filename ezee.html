    <a id="caption">Introduction</a><br>
    <p>The awareness for a vegan diet has never been higher. Health benefits such as lower blood sugar level, and a significantly diminished risk of heart disease have been documented in studies over recent years. Abandonment of meat and dairy
      products consumption reduces carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, too.</p><br>
    <a id="caption">Problem</a><br>
    <p>Nutrition: The level of misinformation and confusion is high. Vegan eating is often considered unhealthy, lacking to provide the body sufficiently with proteins and vitamin B12 for example.<br>
      Cooking: Finding a recipe with Google e.g. delivers an overwhelming number of results and makes it difficult, especially for inexperienced cooks or newly vegans to recognise a good recipe. It‘s time consuming and the outcome isn‘t reliable. If
      the meal turns out to be a disappointment, it will also discourage the cook.</p><br>
    <a id="caption">Solution</a><br>
    <p>It's the perfect opportunity to establish an application with vegan recipes, nutritional information, and qualified experts ready to guide the users. The app can be customised to serve beginners and experienced vegans alike, providing a whole
      range of information and cooking inspiration.</p>

        <h4>1.Step: Research and Interviews</h4>
        <p>Based on the results from the first survey we go into detail by interviewing four candidates, covering different life styles and cooking habits – from omnivore with interest in healthly eating to longtime vegan. The interviews took place
          via Zoom/Skype. To my surprise the interviewees had concerns video calling an expert. This is mainly due to lack of trust and insecurity of video calling a stranger.<br></p>
<br><br>
          <a id="caption">Insights</a>
        <p><a id="caption">1. The Expert</a><br>
        There is so much information about vegan eating and especially people new to this topic are insecure. Anyone can claim to be an expert. Experts with a cooking or nutritionist background are a must. And, for video calls we need to build up
          trust and prove that our expert is trustworthy.</p><br>
          <p><a id="caption">Features:</a> By showing easy recipes, advice and cooking sessions the users experience the living proof. It could reduce the barrier of contacting a stranger. A rating system delivers additional guidance for users who want
          to contact an expert.
        </p><br>
        <br>
        <a id="caption">2. Behaviour Phone & Apps</a><br>
        <p>Communicating through WhatsApp is by far more popular than Video Calls. The advantages are that good reception isn’t as crucial, you can leave Voice Messages and communicate while you´re on the go. Keeping in mind that the expert has to
          prove his/her trustworthiness, it would be a good idea to let the user choose a communication channel.</p><br>
          <p><a id="caption">Features:</a> An additional chat function on top of the video calls would be appreciated by the users. And by giving the video call more functions like “Make an appointment” or “Call back” could make it more attractive.
        </p><br>
        <br>
        <a id="caption">3. Interviewees</a><br>
        <p>The interviewees show great interest in vegan eating and are willing to try it or already cook vegan. They often use Google when they look for a new recipe which can be very frustrating. Their aim is to feel proud of what they created, to
          have reassurance of the time and effort they invested was worth it. The motivation level is high, with laziness popping up every now and then.</pr><br>
          <p><a id="caption">Features:</a> It would be helpful to make daily suggestions, to spread inspiration. Additional online cooking sessions offer full guidance and include interaction. A friendly daily reminder to treat yourself with a
          home-cooked vegan meal could also be useful to keep it up.

          <h4>2.Step: The Survey</h4><a id="caption">Studying the Users Needs</a>
          <p>Conducting an online survey helps to find out if the general idea of the app is welcomed by the target audience. By posing general questions we will get a first glimpse of the needs and goals, too.
            The outcome was very reassuring indeed: Not only does the vast majority already have cooking apps (81%), the participants are open to vegan nutrition (Question No. 7)</p>

          <a id="caption">User Persona</a>
          <p>To create a user persona I applied following methods:<br>
            1. Statistics from organisations such as Statista and ProVeg<br>
            2. Survey for basic information i.e. age, household size and cooking habits<br>
            3. Interviews for detailed insights, such as needs & goals, and fears<br>
            The results were used to form three personas. They helped me develop the app throughout the process and ensure I kept focused.</p><br>
          <a id="caption">User Journey</a>
          <p>To understand how customers find and interact with the service I created User Journeys. Looking at them I think about solution to reach their most important goals.<br><a id="caption">Pain Point:</a> The recipe will turn out as a fail<br>
